# Home-Automation-based-on-MQTT-protocol
This is a home automation project that utilizes the MQTT subscribe-publish protocol to control components.
The central aggregator used in this project is the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller.
The AC bulb is connected in the Normally Open confirguration resulting in a "LOW" value completing the circuit and turning the light on and vice-versa.
